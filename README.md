# Neural Network Rough Draft for Digit Recognition

This repository contains a **rough draft** of a neural network developed for recognizing handwritten digits through python. The model uses OpenCV for image processing and a neural network for classification. The project is still in its early stages of development and is intended for experimentation and learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a neural network that can classify handwritten digits (0-9) using OpenCV to preprocess images. This is a **work in progress**, with plans to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy and efficiency over time.

### Current Features:
- Basic convolutional neural network architecture for digit recognition.
- Built an interactive system using OpenCV that allows users to draw digits, preprocesses them dynamically, and predicts the digit with the trained model
- Still under development; improvements are planned.
